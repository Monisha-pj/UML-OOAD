Project Description
This project involves designing a system using various UML diagrams to capture requirements and represent them graphically. These diagrams facilitate a better understanding and communication of system design.

UML Diagram Classification
The UML diagrams are broadly categorized into Structural and Behavioral diagrams, as represented below:

UML Diagrams
Use Case Diagram: Shows interactions between users and the system.
Class Diagram: Illustrates the system’s structure, including classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.
Sequence Diagram: Depicts interactions between objects in a sequence of steps over time.
Activity Diagram: Displays the flow of activities within the system, including decision points and parallel processing.
Communication Diagram: Shows how objects interact in a specific context by focusing on the relationships and messages passed between them.
State Machine Diagram: Represents the different states of an object and the transitions between these states based on events.
Timing Diagram: Shows object states and interactions over a time period, focusing on state changes.
Interaction Overview Diagram: Combines elements of activity and sequence diagrams to provide an overview of control flow between interactions.
Component Diagram: Depicts the organization and dependencies among system components.
Deployment Diagram: Represents the hardware and software environment for deployment.
Object Diagram: Provides a snapshot of objects and their relationships at a specific point in time.
Composite Structure Diagram: Illustrates the internal structure of a class or component, including internal interactions.
Package Diagram: Organizes the model into packages to show dependencies between different parts of the system.
Profile Diagram: Customizes and extends UML elements for specific domains using stereotypes, tags, and constraints.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ooad-lab.git
Open the UML diagrams in a tool like StarUML, Visual Paradigm, or Lucidchart to view or edit.
Usage
Review the UML diagrams to understand the system's requirements and interactions.
Modify the diagrams as needed to adapt to new requirements or scenarios.
