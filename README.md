## Project Description
This project involves designing a system using various UML diagrams to capture requirements and represent them graphically. These diagrams facilitate a better understanding and communication of system design.

## UML Diagram Classification
The UML diagrams are broadly categorized into **Structural** and **Behavioral** diagrams, as represented below:

```

## UML Diagrams
- **Use Case Diagram**: Shows interactions between users and the system.
- **Class Diagram**: Illustrates the system’s structure, including classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.
- **Sequence Diagram**: Depicts interactions between objects in a sequence of steps over time.
- **Activity Diagram**: Displays the flow of activities within the system, including decision points and parallel processing.
- **Communication Diagram**: Shows how objects interact in a specific context by focusing on the relationships and messages passed between them.
- **State Machine Diagram**: Represents the different states of an object and the transitions between these states based on events.
- **Timing Diagram**: Shows object states and interactions over a time period, focusing on state changes.
- **Interaction Overview Diagram**: Combines elements of activity and sequence diagrams to provide an overview of control flow between interactions.
- **Component Diagram**: Depicts the organization and dependencies among system components.
- **Deployment Diagram**: Represents the hardware and software environment for deployment.
- **Object Diagram**: Provides a snapshot of objects and their relationships at a specific point in time.
- **Composite Structure Diagram**: Illustrates the internal structure of a class or component, including internal interactions.
- **Package Diagram**: Organizes the model into packages to show dependencies between different parts of the system.
- **Profile Diagram**: Customizes and extends UML elements for specific domains using stereotypes, tags, and constraints.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ooad-lab.git
2. Open the UML diagrams in a tool like StarUML, Visual Paradigm, or Lucidchart to view or edit.
   
## Usage
1. Review the UML diagrams to understand the system's requirements and interactions.
2. Modify the diagrams as needed to adapt to new requirements or scenarios.
